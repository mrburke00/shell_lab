Eval
	-First task is to call the parseline function, which parses the        space-separated command line arguments and builds the argv            vector 
	-The first argument is assumed to be the name of a built in shell      that is interpretted immediately or an exectuable object file        that will run in the context of a new child process
	-If the last argument is an '&' character, then parseline returns     1, indicating that the program should be executed in the             background,thus the shell does not wait for it to complete
	Otherwise it returns 0, indicating that the program should be run     in the foreground, thus the shell waits for it to complete
	-If builtin_command returns 0, then the shell creates a child         process and executes the requested program inside the child.
	-If the user has asked for the program to run in the background,    then the shell retuns to the top of the loop and waits for the        next commands line
	- Otherwise the shell uses the waipid function to wait for the      job to terminate
